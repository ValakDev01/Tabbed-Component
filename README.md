# Tabbed Component Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project features a tabbed component implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The component allows users to switch between different content sections by clicking on tabs, providing a clean and interactive way to display multiple pieces of information within a single view. When a tab is clicked, the script removes the active class from all tabs and content sections, then adds the active class to the selected tab and the corresponding content section. This dynamic interaction ensures that only the content related to the clicked tab is visible, enhancing the user experience by organizing information efficiently.
